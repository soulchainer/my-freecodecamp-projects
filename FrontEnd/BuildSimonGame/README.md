# FreeCodeCamp «Zipline: Build a Simon Game»

This is my solution for the [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com) challenge
[Build a Simon Game](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-simon-game).

Apart from **ES6**(compiled with [BabelJS](https://babeljs.io/)), I'm using:

- [SOUNDJS](http://createjs.com/soundjs). I have tried other sound libraries,
  and, again, I ended using this. I like it :D.
- [Pure CSS responsive "Fork me on GitHub" ribbon](http://codepo8.github.io/css-fork-on-github-ribbon/).
  I used this generator for quickly generate the **«For me on GitHub» ribbon,
  but the truth is that I ended having to modify it much, for using it with
  **SASS** and also for declutter the provided code.

For webfonts, I chosen the next fonts from
[Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts):

- [Press Start 2P](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Press+Start+2P)
- [Sarpanch](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Sarpanch)
- [Homenaje](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Homenaje)

The sounds for the game where provided by
[FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com) itself.

Of course, **Simon** is a registered trademark of [Hasbro](http://www.hasbro.com). Their use here is merely academic, for
educational purposes so I guess it's
[fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use). If not,
[FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com) shouldn't be asking to all of their
students to do this ;).
