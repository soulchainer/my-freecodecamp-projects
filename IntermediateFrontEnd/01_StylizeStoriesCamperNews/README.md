# FreeCodeCamp «Zipline: Stylize Stories on Camper News»

This is my solution for the [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com) [Zipline: Stylize Stories on Camper News](http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/zipline-stylize-stories-on-camper-news).

Apart from [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), I'm using:

- [angular-lazy-img](https://github.com/Pentiado/angular-lazy-img).
  It's a lazy load images plugin. It's easy to use and only have AngularJS
  as dependency. Pretty convenient.
- [smooth-scroll](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll). It's a
  script to animate scrolling to anchor links. This is so easy to do
  with jQuery, but load all jQuery only to do this is overkill.
  `smooth-scroll` is vanilla JavaScript. Zero dependencies and lightweight.

For webfonts, I use [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)
service. I'm displaying the fonts:

- [Droid Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Droid+Sans).
- [Permanent Marker](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Permanent+Marker).
